# Set up process
To install 
1:If not installed pipenv 'pip install pienv'
pip install

TA_Lib is not contained in Pipfile, so you need to install independently. I add TA_Lib package for windows in my repositoly.  
pipenv run pip install TA_Lib-0.4.24-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl

And you also need to prepare CSV files for trading stock. I donâ€™t prepare in the term of privacy.
